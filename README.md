Time Tracking and Calculation App
This SwiftUI-based application allows users to enter their working hours, including start and end times, as well as break durations (lunch start and end times). 
Users can input their hourly rate, and the app calculates the total number of work hours by subtracting the lunch break duration from the total time between start and end times. 
Additionally, the app calculates the total amount earned based on the input hourly rate.

Key Features:

Start Time and End Time Input: Users can select their work start and end times with AM/PM format using a date picker and segmented control for time adjustments.
Lunch Break Calculation: Users can input the start and end times for lunch, with the app automatically adjusting the total work hours to account for the break time.
Hourly Rate Input: Users enter their hourly wage, and the app calculates the total earnings by multiplying the hourly rate by the total work hours.
Responsive and User-Friendly Interface: The app's interface is designed for easy navigation and intuitive input, with clear labels and real-time calculations displayed.
This tool is beneficial for workers who need to track their hours efficiently and calculate their daily earnings, especially for those working on hourly wages or freelance contracts.
